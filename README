This is the tournament managing system of Helsingin yliopiston salamurhaajat (Assassins at the University of Helsinki). Its immediate function was to replace the old, PHP-based, high-maintain tournament system.
The current version is in active use and updated constantly with small feature upgrades.
The long-term plan includes moving MVC stuff where it belongs (probably using a decorator pattern), streamlining the user role system, and actually trying to adhere to the DRY principle. This may require heavy rewriting and thus will be postponed to somewhere Nov/2011 onwards.

Current features include e.g.:
-Multiple tournaments in parallel
-Team tournaments
-Per-tournament referee roles
-automatic login generation when registering for the tournament
